# Chrome Extension with React.js

This repository serves as my personal learning project where I am building a Chrome extension using React.js. The goal is to explore how React can be used in a Chrome extension context, including features like popup UI, background scripts, and interaction with the Chrome API.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chrome-extension-reactjs.git
   cd chrome-extension-reactjs
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Load the Chrome extension:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" in the top right.
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the `build` directory inside your project.

## Features

- **Popup UI**: Displays a simple React UI when the extension icon is clicked.
- **Background Script**: Handles background tasks, such as monitoring browser activity or handling extension-specific events.
- **Chrome API Integration**: Interacts with Chrome's APIs (e.g., tabs, storage) for dynamic functionality.

## Usage

1. After loading the extension into Chrome, click on the extension icon in the toolbar to view the popup UI.
2. The background script runs independently to handle any continuous or event-driven operations.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the extension's UI.
- **Webpack**: To bundle the code and assets.
- **Babel**: To transpile modern JavaScript to be compatible with most browsers.
- **Chrome Extensions API**: For interacting with Chrome features like tabs, storage, etc.
